# IDM

Internet download manager (IDM) is a popular download manager software. It is a paid software but you can use it for free by using a crack. But it is not recommended to use cracked software. It is better to use free and open-source software like uGet or Xtreme Download Manager. (-AI)

IDM is a paid software. But you can use it for free for 30 days. After 30 days, you can't use it anymore. And you can actually trick this part. (Like reseting again and again).
