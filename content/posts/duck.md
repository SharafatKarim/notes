# Duck?

It's actually <duck.com> or your favorite duckduckgo!

## Email protection

Head over to,

- <https://duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/email-protection/duck-addresses/how-do-i-compose-a-new-email/>

And in this way, suppose,

```
From : sharafat2004@gmail.com
To   : sharafat2004@gmail.com
```

You can send an email to yourself, through duck address. In this case, just send it to,

```
Duck : sharafat@duck.com # It's just my duck address
To   : sharafat2004_at_gmail.com_sharafat@duck.com
```

Preety interesting, right?
