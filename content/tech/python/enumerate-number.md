```Python
# Python program to illustrate
# enumerate function in loops
l1 = ["eat", "sleep", "repeat"]

# printing the tuples in object directly
for ele in enumerate(l1):
	print (ele)

# changing index and printing separately
for count, ele in enumerate(l1, 100):
	print (count, ele)

# getting desired output from tuple
for count, ele in enumerate(l1):
	print(count)
	print(ele)
```
