Official guide is actually good,

Still let me explain a bit,

First let’s create,

```Bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3306:3306  --name mdb -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=Password123! -d mariadb:latest
```

> p for port forwarding, d for detached, e for environment variable, —name for custom name, I guess

---

now to connect,

```Bash
docker exec -it mdb mariadb --user root -pPassword123!
```

from TLDR;
