## Mid Term Examination: July–December 2023

**Course Code:** CIT 322 | **Course Title:** Operating Systems Sessional
**Session:** 2020-21 | **Program:** B.Sc. Engg.(CSE) | **Semester:** 6th
**Total Marks:** 15 | **Instructions:** Answer the marked questions.

### SET-A (Answer any one from 1 to 3)

1. ~~Implement Peterson's solution for ensuring synchronization. **[07]**~~
    
2. ~~Implement mutex locks to ensure synchronization.~~
    
3. ~~Semaphore implementation to solve busy waiting problem.~~
    

### SET-B (Answer one from 4–5; Question 6 is mandatory)

**[✓] 4. Multithreading Basics [04]**

Write a code to demonstrate how to create and start Python's or Java's threads using the threading module (or `Thread` class).

- It should run a function `print_name` that prints a name along with provided arguments.
    
- This example should create two threads, start them using the `start()` method, and wait for completion using the `join()` method.
    

**5. Concurrent Calculation [04]**

Write code to use Python's or Java's threading module to calculate the square and cube of a number concurrently.

- Create two threads (`t1` and `t2`) for these calculations.
    
- Print results in parallel and print "Done!" only when both threads finish.
    
- _Note: Threading is used to achieve parallelism and improve performance for computationally intensive tasks._
    

**6. Linux Command Operations [04]**

Perform/Explain the following terminal operations:

1. Display information about files in the current directory. 
   ```bash
   ls
   ls -lah
   ```
    
2. Create a directory with your own student name; inside it, create a file. Then create a directory in the home directory and copy the previously created file there.
   ```bash
   mkdir sharafat
   touch text.txt
   cp /home/sharafat/sharafat/test.txt /home/sharafat/test
   cp test.txt ~/test
   ```
    
3. Navigate between different folders.
   ```bash
   cd
   ```
    
4. Remove empty directories from the directory list.
   ```bash
   find . -type d -delete
   ```
    
5. File copy/cut and paste operations via terminal.
   ```bash
   cp source/ destination/
   mv source/ destination/
   ```
    
6. Download files from the internet.
   ```bash
   wget URL
   aria2c URL
   ```
    
7. Display the current user's name.
   ```bash
   whoami
   echo $USER
   ```
    
8. View the calendar in the terminal.
   ```bash
   cal
   cal 8 11 2002
   ```
    
9. Check the details of the file system.
   ```bash
   neofetch
   fastfetch
   lscpu
   lsblk
   ```
    
10. Check lines, word count, and characters in a file using different options.
    ```bash
    wc filename
    wc -l filename
    wc -c filename
    wc --help
    ```

## Mid Term Examination: July–December 2020

**Course Code:** CIT 322 | **Course Title:** Operating Systems Sessional

**Session:** 2017-18 | **Program:** B.Sc. Engg.(CSE) | **Semester:** 6th

**Total Marks:** 15 | **Instructions:** Answer the marked questions.

### ~~1. FCFS Scheduling Analysis [10]~~

~~Consider three CPU-bound processes arriving at an FCFS scheduler:~~

|$P_3$|5|1|

- ~~**Tasks:** Give the schedule (Gantt Chart) and compute the average waiting time.~~
    
- ~~**Analysis:** Define the "Convoy Effect." Provide an alternative arrival order that improves average waiting time and a second order that demonstrates the convoy effect.~~
    

### ~~2. Comparative Scheduling [10]~~

~~Compare the average waiting time for FCFS, SJF, and SRTF for the following processes:~~

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Process**|**Arrival Time**|**Burst Time**|
|$P_1$|0|8|
|$P_2$|3|3|
|$P_3$|5|4|
|$P_4$|6|6|

### ~~3. Algorithm Simulation~~

~~**[✓] 3. Simulate the CPU scheduling algorithm Round-Robin.** **[10]**~~

4. ~~Simulate the Priority Scheduling algorithm (Random). **[10]**~~

5. ~~Simulate the First Come First Serve (FCFS) algorithm. **[10]**~~

6. ~~Simulate the Shortest Job First (SJF) (Non-Preemptive) algorithm. **[10]**~~

7. ~~Simulate the Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm. **[10]**~~
